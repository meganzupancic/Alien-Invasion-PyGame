Alien Invasion: Cybersecurity Edition

Overview:
This repository is based on the source code from the SFWE 101 class, where we originally developed an Alien Invasion game using Pygame. In SFWE 401, we are taking that same source code and analyzing it for security vulnerabilities. Our goal is to exploit these vulnerabilities to demonstrate potential cyberattacks and then apply secure coding practices to harden the application against threats.

Objectives:
- Identify security weaknesses in the original Alien Invasion game code.
- Simulate potential cyberattacks using the vulnerabilities.
- Modify the source code to mitigate security risks.
- Apply secure coding practices and document the improvements.

Technologies Used:
Python (Pygame for game development)

GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
